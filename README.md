# MPG Predictor (Linear Regression)
This project uses simple linear regression to predict car fuel efficiency (MPG) based on engine displacement using a custom-built gradient descent algorithm.

---

## 🚗 Problem Statement
Can we predict a vehicle's miles-per-gallon (MPG) based on the size of its engine (displacement)?

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Cleaned Auto MPG Dataset
- **Features**:
  - `displacement`: Engine size in cubic inches
  - `mpg`: Fuel efficiency in miles per gallon

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

---

## ✅ Results
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 28.88 *(example)*
- Learned model: `mpg = -0.0426 * displacement + 38.54`
- Prediction: A car with 200 cu in displacement is predicted to have **16.02 MPG**
